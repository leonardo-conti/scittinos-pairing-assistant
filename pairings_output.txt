Rationale:
  For a Ravens tailgate of 50 people, we've designed a menu featuring Scittino's crowd-pleasing Italian specialties that are easy to serve and eat at a tailgate. The butcher shop offerings (sausages, chicken) can be grilled on-site, while prepared items like meatballs and subs are ready-to-serve. We've included both hot and cold options, plus plenty of appetizers and sides. The dessert selection offers variety and easy portion control. For drinks, we've suggested both alcoholic and non-alcoholic options, with a note that alcohol should be brought by guests per typical tailgate etiquette.
